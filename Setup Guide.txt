Step 1: Get the Project Files

Copy all the project files into a single folder on the new machine:

Customer.java

DBConnection.java

Main.java

Product.java

ReturnRequest.java

SalesTransaction.java

ConnectionTest.java

db_setup.sql

mysql-connector-j-8.0.33.jar (The MySQL Driver)

Step 2: Configure the Database Connection

This is a mandatory step. Open DBConnection.java in a text editor and update these lines to match the new machine's MySQL server:

// Make sure the port (e.g., 3307 or 3306) matches the local MySQL server
private static final String URL = "jdbc:mysql://localhost:3307/modelkit_returns?useSSL=false&serverTimezone=UTC";

// Make sure this is the root password for the local MySQL server
private static final String PASS = "YOUR_NEW_PASSWORD";


Step 3: Create the Database Schema

This is a mandatory step.

Open MySQL Workbench and connect to your server (using the port and password you set in Step 2).

Go to File > Open SQL Script... and select the db_setup.sql file.

Click the lightning bolt icon in the toolbar to execute the entire script.

This creates the modelkit_returns database and all required tables.

Step 4: Compile the Java Code

Open a terminal (Command Prompt, PowerShell, or Terminal) and navigate to your project folder.

Run the javac command to compile all your .java files into .class files:

javac *.java


Step 5: Run the Application

In the same terminal, run the java command using the classpath (-cp) flag. This is required to link the MySQL driver.

On Windows:

java -cp ".;mysql-connector-j-8.0.33.jar" Main


On macOS/Linux:

java -cp ".:mysql-connector-j-8.0.33.jar" Main


The application menu will now appear, fully connected to the database.
